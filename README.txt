Design Pattern and Components Used

MVVM Pattern
Dagger
Coroutines
Retrofit
Navigation UI

Justification for selected Design of App
App Itself is very simple with very basic features and API data, I did not need MVVM for this app and a simple MVC or legacy design was more then enough.
Since Criteria of Test was to use preferred tools and patterns, I decided to use defined components and Pattern.
App Makes use of coroutines to create async data retrieval from api and populating UI which makes UI very smooth
Using. MVVM this current app is easily extendable
Using Latest Libraries and tools makes it future proof
I could have included a bit more of MVVM showcase by adding ROOM database and making use of Live Data, but due to lack to time I decided to follow the criteria
